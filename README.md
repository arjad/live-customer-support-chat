<h1>CHAT APP</h1>
    <p>made on drift to chat via email</p>
    <p>Drift is a messaging app that allows you to talk to your website visitors and customers in real-time, from anywhere.

        Use Drift to shorten your sales cycle, convert more leads, and keep your customers happy. Over 50,000 businesses choose Drift to give their prospects a red carpet experience.
        
        Here’s the problem: 98% of people will visit your website and then leave without doing a single thing. But with Drift on your website, you can change that simply by saying hello and starting a conversation — just like you would in-person. And once you turn that website visitor into a customer, you can use Drift to send targeted in-app messages, surveys to get customer feedback, and more.
        
        And with Drift on your Android, you can manage all of those conversations and reply to people on the go, too.
